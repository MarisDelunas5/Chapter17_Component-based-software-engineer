        <h4>Chapter 17 ■ Component-based software engineering</h4>
        <p>
          As I explained in Chapter 16, many new business systems are now
          developed by configuring off-the-shelf systems. However, when a
          company cannot use an off-the-shelf system because it does not meet
          their requirements, the software they need has to be specially
          developed. For custom software, component-based software engineering
          is an effective, reuse-oriented way to develop new enterprise systems.
          Component-based software engineering (CBSE) emerged in the late 1990s
          as an approach to software systems development based on reusing
          software components. Its creation was motivated by designers’
          frustration that object-oriented development had not led to extensive
          reuse, as had been originally suggested. Single object classes were
          too detailed and specific, and often had to be bound with an
          application at compile time. You had to have detailed knowledge of the
          classes to use them, and this usually meant that you had to have the
          component source code. This meant that selling or distributing objects
          as individual reusable components was practically impossible.
          Components are higher-level abstractions than objects and are defined
          by their interfaces. They are usually larger than individual objects
          and all implementation details are hidden from other components. CBSE
          is the process of defining, implementing, and integrating or composing
          loosely coupled, independent components into systems. It has become as
          an important software development approach because software systems
          are becoming larger and more complex. Customers are demanding more
          dependable software that is delivered and deployed more quickly. The
          only way that we can cope with complexity and deliver better software
          more quickly is to reuse rather than reimplement software components.
        </p>
        <p>The essentials of component-based software engineering are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Independent components that are completely specified by their
            interfaces. There should be a clear separation between the component
            interface and its implementation. This means that one implementation
            of a component can be replaced by another, without changing other
            parts of the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Component standards that facilitate the integration of components.
            These standards are embodied in a component model. They define, at
            the very minimum, how component interfaces should be specified and
            how components communicate. Some models go much further and define
            interfaces that should be implemented by all conformant components.
            If components conform to standards, then their operation is
            independent of their programming language. Components written in
            different languages can be integrated into the same system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Middleware that provides software support for component integration.
            To make independent, distributed components work together, you need
            middleware support that handles component communications. Middleware
            for component support handles low-level issues efficiently and
            allows you to focus on application-related problems. In addition,
            middleware for component support may provide support for resource
            allocation, transaction management, security, and concurrency
          </li>
          <li>
            A development process that is geared to component-based software
            engineering. You need a development process that allows requirements
            to evolve, depending on the functionality of available components. I
            discuss CBSE development processes in Section 17.2. Component-based
            development embodies good software engineering practice. It makes
            sense to design a system using components, even if you have to
            develop rather than reuse these components.
          </li>
          <p>
            Underlying CBSE are sound design principles that support the
            construction of understandable and maintainable software:
          </p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Components are independent so they do not interfere with each
            other’s operation. Implementation details are hidden. The
            component’s implementation can be changed without affecting the rest
            of the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Components communicate through well-defined interfaces. If these
            interfaces are maintained, one component can be replaced by another,
            which provides additional or enhanced functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Component infrastructures offer a range of standard services that
            can be used in application systems. This reduces the amount of new
            code that has to be developed.
          </li>
          <p>
            The initial motivation for CBSE was the need to support both reuse
            and distributed software engineering. A component was seen as an
            element of a software system that could be accessed, using a remote
            procedure call mechanism, by other components running on separate
            computers. Each system that reused a component had to incorporate
            its own copy of that component. This idea of a component extended
            the notion of distributed objects, as defined in distributed systems
            models such as the CORBA specification (Pope, 1997). Several
            different protocols and standards have been developed to support
            this view of a component, such as Sun’s Enterprise Java Beans (EJB),
            Microsoft’s COM and .NET, and CORBA’s CCM (Lau and Wang, 2007). In
            practice, these multiple standards have hindered the uptake of CBSE.
            It was impossible for components developed using different
            approaches to work together. Components that are developed for
            different platforms, such as .NET or J2EE, cannot interoperate.
            Furthermore, the standards and protocols proposed were complex and
            difficult to understand. This was also a barrier to their adoption.
            In response to these problems, the notion of a component as a
            service was developed, and standards were proposed to support
            service-oriented software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most significant difference between a component as a service and
            the original notion of a component is that services are stand-alone
            entities that are external to a program using them. When you build a
            service-oriented system, you reference the external service rather
            than including a copy of that service in your system.
            Service-oriented software engineering, which I discuss in Chapter
            19, is therefore a type of component-based software engineering. It
            uses a simpler notion of a component than that originally proposed
            in CBSE. It has been driven, from the outset, by standards. In
            situations where COTS-based reuse is impractical, service-oriented
            CBSE is becoming the dominant approach for the development of
            business systems.
